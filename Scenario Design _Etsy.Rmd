## Question 3: How can I help the buyers and sellers achieve their goals?

### Primary Approach: Content-Based Filtering (80%)

Etsy's marketplace thrives on uniqueness and individual aesthetic preferences, making content-based filtering the ideal primary recommendation strategy. This approach learns from what users browse, favorite, and purchase to match their personal style with items that share similar attributes—color palettes, materials, design aesthetics, and craftsmanship qualities.

**Core Content-Based Features:**

- "More Like This" Recommendations: When a buyer engages with an item, instantly suggest 5-10 visually and stylistically similar pieces matching on color, style, materials, price range, and design aesthetic

- Seasonal & Occasion-Based Suggestions: Anticipate buyer needs by surfacing holiday-appropriate items weeks in advance, detect gift-giving intent through search patterns, and track emerging trends to connect early adopters with fresh pieces

- Serendipity & Discovery: Intentionally include unexpected items (15% of recommendations) that are adjacent to but slightly outside typical preferences to balance comfort with surprise and prevent recommendation monotony

- Aesthetic-Based Connections: Group items into style clusters (bohemian, minimalist, vintage, industrial) and enable cross-category discovery so buyers who love minimalist jewelry also discover minimalist home decor

### Secondary Approach: Collaborative Filtering (20%)

Collaborative patterns provide valuable supplementary signals through "Shoppers Like You Also Bought" recommendations, help new users without preference history, and validate which styles are resonating broadly across the marketplace.

**Why This Balance Works for Etsy:** Content-based filtering respects what makes Etsy special—one-of-a-kind, handmade items that can't rely on bestseller popularity. By focusing on aesthetic attributes and style matching, the system helps buyers discover items that feel personally chosen for them while giving sellers with unique, niche products a fair chance to reach their ideal customers.


## Reverse engineering Etsy.com

- Visited Etsy as a new user and browsed items that caught my eye
- Within **10 minutes**, two personalized recommendation carousels appeared on my homepage: "Dive back into these 10 finds" and "Picks inspired by your shopping"
- After favoriting several items and refreshing the page, the carousel order dynamically changed
- Seasonal items (holiday-themed products) moved to the top position after the refresh
- My personalized recommendations based on browsing and favorites appeared as the top two carousels below the seasonal content
- Content recommendations appear more user-focused during active browsing sessions, especially when items are added to the cart
- Once the screen is refreshed, seasonal recommendations are prioritized over personalized content

## Specific recommendations 

**Suggestions on how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward.**


- Include a section at the top where users can enter their interests and those selections should curate their home page.

- Add a "Gift Mode" toggle that allows users to browse and receive recommendations for gift shopping without those interactions affecting their personal style profile and future recommendations.

- Implement explicit feedback buttons (thumbs up/down or "Show me more/less like this") on recommended items so users can actively refine their preferences rather than relying solely on implicit signals.

- Create a "Discover New Sellers" option that temporarily prioritizes recommendations from small or new shops the user hasn't purchased from before, helping both buyer discovery goals and seller visibility goals while preventing over-concentration on familiar sellers.

- Do not update the algorithm so drastically when a user refreshes the page.Allow users to. spend time reviewing the latest recommendations.
